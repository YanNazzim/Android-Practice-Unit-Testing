# Scenario
The Little Lemon restaurant wants to free space in its warehouse and apply a 20% discount to the products that are running out of stock. The maximum amount of product that makes it eligible for a discount is five units. 

If the product is already out of stock, or its amount in stock exceeds 5, then the discount is not applied. Youâ€™re asked to write unit tests to ensure that the existing implementation of discounting logic works correctly.
